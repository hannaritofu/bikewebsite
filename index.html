                <table style="width:100%">
                    <tr>
                        <td>
                            <p><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe helmet should fit snugly all around, with no spaces
                                between the foam and bike rider's head.</p>
                            <p><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbspYour helmet should not sit too high or low on your head. To check, make sure the
                                bottom of the pad inside
                                the front of the helmet is one or two finger widths above
                                the your eyebrows. The back of the helmet should not touch the top of your neck.</p>
                            <p><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe side straps should make a “V” shape under, and be slightly in front of your
                                ears.</p>
                            <p><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe chin strap should be centered under your
                                chin, and fit snugly so that no more than one or two
                                fingers fit between the chin and the strap. Open your mouth wide! The helmet
                                should pull down on your head. If not, the chin strap needs
                                to be tighter. If needed, you can pull the straps from the
                                back of the helmet to adjust the chin straps. Once the
                                chin strap is fastened, the helmet should not move in any
                                direction, back-to-front or side-to-side.</p>
